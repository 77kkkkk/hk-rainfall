    <h1>Monthly Travel Recommendations for Hong Kong</h1>
    <div class="content">
	<div class="recommendation">
            <h2>My Main Recommendation</h2>
            <p>Based on my analysis, the best months I recommend to travel to Hong Kong when there is the least amount of rain are: January, February, March, April, November and December. Hong Kong has beautiful festivals in summer and many gardens that you could visit. Nevertheless, due to hevy rains, I do <u>not</u> recommend to travel in the months of August-October. 
			<br> These recommendations are based on my findings, which you can find for each month below. You can also find graphs of rainfall in the previous years on the "Main" page.<br> Based on the analysis of the four previous years (2020-2024), I recommend to prepare for the same trend of rainfall to continue for the next five years, with little variation of cumulated rainfall figure a year.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="recommendation">
            <h2>January - 0.28 mm</h2>
            <p>January: Based on my analysis, the weather in Hong Kong in January is cool and crisp, with almost no rain. It's the perfect time for a peaceful stroll through the city’s parks or a visit to the famous Victoria Peak, where the views are spectacular. January is also the month for Lunar New Year preparations. While the official celebrations usually begin in February, you can already feel the excitement in the air as the city gets ready for its grand festivities. If you’re into culture, you can enjoy the displays of intricate lanterns and start planning your shopping for the New Year. Perfect for those who prefer quieter days and crisp weather!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="recommendation">
            <h2>February - 2.23 mm</h2>
            <p>February: February brings a little more rain, but it’s still fairly mild. The Lunar New Year usually falls in this month, and Hong Kong transforms into a festival wonderland. From street parades to fireworks, this is when the city really comes alive. Don't miss the spectacular Hong Kong Flower Market, where the scent of fresh blooms fills the air. While you're out celebrating, try the traditional Nian Gao (glutinous rice cake) – a sweet treat that symbolizes good luck and prosperity. If you're into cultural experiences, this is an unforgettable time to visit.</p>
